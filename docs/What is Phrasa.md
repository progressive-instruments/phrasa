# What Is Phrasa?

Phrasa is a language for writing musical structures. 
The language is translated into a sequence of musical events for multiple instruments.

The translated sequence is sent to Phrasa player that will play the music for you.

## The Language

Don't fret. 

Phrasa is not a programming language so you are not required any programming related prerequisite knowledge. Phrasa is a declarative language, meaning you are only declaring information and not logic.

You are also not required any prerequisite musical knowledge. Within the language, you will find all the music theory you require, in order to start composing music.
Of course you will gain additional composing skills from external resources as well.

Once you learn the language, you'd realize that Phrasa makes it much easier for you to compose music:

* By defining the motifs and repeating phrases of your piece, you will avoid repetitive writing and the resulted piece will be much more flexible and extensible

* By defining your piece hierarchy, the time relationship between the different phrases and the harmonic base of each phrase, you will write your music much closer to how we actually experience music.

No more talking, let's start.
